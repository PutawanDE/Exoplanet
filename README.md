# Exoplanet World Generator

This world generator generates an exotic world from a distant galaxy as an additional dimension.

## How to get there?
1. There is a portal block which can teleport you to this exotic world. 2 portal blocks will be given when you spawn. So, you can use the blocks to teleport to Exoplanet and teleport back to Earth.
2. Place the block and interact

## Features
1. **Ore** - this planet has a large ore vein underground (Diamond, Gold, Iron, Copper, Coal).

2. **Red Tree and Grass** - this planet's plants mostly have red leaves as they use different pigment for their photosynthesis.

3. **Undersea Grass** - this planet's grass is special, it can grow both on the ground and undersea.

4. **Glowing Grass** - this planet is far too different from Earth. The grass here can glow in the dark. At night, Exoplanet is not really dark at all.
